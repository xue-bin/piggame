# Pig Game

This is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a target score.

## Game Rules

1. The game is played by two players, who take turns rolling a six-sided dice.
2. On each turn, a player rolls the dice and accumulates points based on the number rolled.
   - If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose all the points accumulated in that turn.
   - If the player rolls any other number (2-6), the rolled number is added to their turn score.
3. The player can choose to roll the dice again to accumulate more points or end their turn.
   - If the player ends their turn, their turn score is added to their total score.
4. The first player to reach the target score (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.
